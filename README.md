# Visual-Musleh
My Attempt at visualisation using three.js

In order to view everything properly (or just a preference) got the directory containing this git and run a simple http server:

  python -m SimpleHTTPServer
  
Then from the browser simply go to localhost:8000 (or what ever port you specify when running the http server) You should be able to view it there.

Feel free to write your name as you can change the name variable in the html file:

  var name = "MUSL3H";
